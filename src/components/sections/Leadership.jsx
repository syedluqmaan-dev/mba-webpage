It has a shortage of professionals who are genuinely ready — to think independently, to lead responsibly, and to perform under the pressures that real organisations place on them. GSBM was established to close that gap, not incrementally, but decisively. We are not building a school for rankings or recognition. We are building one for outcomes — for students who will go on to run enterprises, lead teams, and contribute to this country's growth in ways that matter. That is the only measure I am interested in."

A business school located within the same ecosystem as GIEC is not a coincidence; it is a statement of intent. We want our students to graduate not just as managers, but as problem-solvers who create value for the communities they serve.',

With my Economics graduation from the University of Chicago and an MBA from University College London, UK, and experience across healthcare and education, I strongly believe GSBM must blend cutting-edge knowledge with a strong human touch in this AI-driven era.Our focus remains on developing ethical decision-makers who prioritize sustainability, real-world impact, and genuine employability.Together, let us build business education that not only creates successful professionals but also responsible citizens committed to the greater social good.`,

    message: `The businesses I have worked with across four continents consistently struggled to find one thing: managers who could think, decide, and lead under pressure. GSBM exists to build exactly that — professionals with both the rigour and the resilience that real organisations demand. Management education that stays close to industry does not just improve employability; it improves enterprises. That is the standard we are committed to here.`,

We strive to provide a relaxed but disciplined ecosystem for students' all-round development.The central focus is to transform students into confident, knowledgeable, and skilled individuals who are not only ready for various jobs but also conditioned to think and create jobs. Employability is the key idea.`,
